# PROG 110 – Fall 2025  
## Programming Assignment 1 — ACME Anvils Order Taking  

**Summary:**  
This week, I created a C# console application that allows a clerk to take a single order for Acme Anvils Corporation. The program collects customer shipping information and the number of anvils, calculates the subtotal, tax, and total, and then displays a formatted invoice.  

**Key Skills Practiced:**  
- Console input/output (`WriteLine`, `ReadLine`, `ReadKey`)  
- Using variables, constants, and different data types (`int`, `string`, `decimal`, `double`)  
- Arithmetic operations and tax calculations  
- String formatting (interpolation and concatenation)  
- Console output formatting for readability  

**Goal:**  
Build the first phase of an order-taking system to learn data handling, user input, and formatted output in C#.
