# PROG 110 – Fall 2025  
## Programming Assignment 1 — ACME Anvils Order Taking  

**Summary:**  
This week, I created a C# console application that allows a clerk to take a single order for Acme Anvils Corporation. The program collects customer shipping information and the number of anvils, calculates the subtotal, tax, and total, and then displays a formatted invoice.  

**Key Skills Practiced:**  
- Console input/output (`WriteLine`, `ReadLine`, `ReadKey`)  
- Using variables, constants, and different data types (`int`, `string`, `decimal`, `double`)  
- Arithmetic operations and tax calculations  
- String formatting (interpolation and concatenation)  
- Console output formatting for readability  

**Goal:**  
Build the first phase of an order-taking system to learn data handling, user input, and formatted output in C#.

## Programming Assignment 2 — ACME Anvils Order Taking (Version 2.0)  

**Summary:**  
This week, I updated my previous ACME Anvils Order Taking program to Version 2.0. The new version includes several enhancements such as a loyalty discount, free gift options, dynamic pricing based on quantity, and updated tax and shipping rules.  

**Key Skills Practiced:**  
- Conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, `else`, and the conditional operator (`? :`)  
- Switch statements and logical operators (`&&`, `||`)  
- Case-insensitive input handling using `ToUpper()`  
- Advanced calculations for discounts, tax, and shipping  
- Use of constants, rounding methods, and data validation  
- Improved output formatting and structured invoice display  

**Program Features:**  
- 10% sales tax rate applied to all orders  
- Loyalty discount (15%) for Futility Club members  
- Tiered pricing per anvil based on quantity ordered  
- Optional free gift selection (Pogo Stick or Jar of Bumble Bees)  
- Conditional free shipping for CA and OR customers with small orders  
- Fully formatted invoice with right-aligned currency values  
- Clear “thank you” and promotional closing messages  

**Goal:**  
Enhance the first ACME Order Taking application by introducing real-world logic and customer options while practicing structured programming and clean console output design.
